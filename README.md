This repository contains Matlab code implementing Minimum Probability
Flow learning for several cases, specifically:

    MPF_ising/ - parameter estimation in the Ising model
    MPF_RBM_compare_log_likelihood/ - parameter estimation in
        Restricted Boltzmann Machines. This directory also includes
        code comparing the log likelihood of small RBMs trained via
        pseudolikelihood and Contrastive Divergence to ones trained
        via MPF..

If you're interesting in using MPF to build an Ising model of neural spike data, you should check out Liberty Hamilton's repository at https://github.com/libertyh/ising-model.
